\index{Putnam!2002}
Given any five points on a sphere, show that some four of them must lie on a closed hemisphere.
\end{problem}

\begin{soln}
Consider a great circle passing through at least two of the five points. Then at least one closed hemisphere contains at least two of the remaining three points. This concludes the proof. 
% See \cite[Example 3.2]{CharmingProofs}.
