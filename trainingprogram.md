Here are some of the [suggestions](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-contest.html#C-0) from [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/) regarding the preparation of Math Olympiad. 

> * Pick up any standard textbook to work through, so you learn some of the standard theory that is tested in math contests. 
> * Go through some past problems from previous contests. 
> * Rope some friends into learning with you. It’s more fun that way, and you can learn from each other. 
> * You should repeat these steps until you have some comfort with the kinds of problems that appear.
> * As you get experience, you will automatically start to know what deep understanding feels like. 
> * Be aware that you will see many, many problems which you can’t solve, where you read the solution and ask, “how was I supposed to think of that?”. This is okay and expected: it’s not because you’re dumb, it’s because you are learning.

## [A few training programs](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/resources/)

#### The [<span style="color: royalblue"> **OTIS program**</span>](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html)
  * Olympiad Training for Individual Study, run by [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/) and [people](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html#people), is **a proof-based olympiad training program, with over [300 students](https://web.evanchen.cc/upload/public-CV.pdf) per year from across the world**.
  * [Sunaina Pati](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/student-profile.php?id=sunaina.ug2023), who [received](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2282/) a Silver medal in [EGMO 2023](https://www.egmo.org/egmos/egmo12/), remarked the following in a post discussing [How to start with Math olympiads](https://www.omath.club/2022/03/how%20to%20start%20with%20math%20olympiads.html).
   > Do join OTIS! It is simply so good. Evan is also very kind with financial aid. Moreover, do not be scared of applying! And if there is some financial burden, do tell to Evan.

#### [<span style="color: royalblue"> **The Sophie Fellowship**</span>](https://www.sophiefellowship.in/home)
  * It is a training program and fellowship for students preparing for IMO, EGMO, INMO and other national and international mathematical competitions.
  * It is a student-run initiative to assist selected high schoolers passionate about mathematics, by offering help from people who have performed well at various mathematical contests such as the IMO, APMO, EGMO, and INMO.
  * The program will be completely free of cost.
  * It is run by a bunch of students who really like math and want to spread it further in the country. They aim to improve the quality of math education in India by making Olympiad math more accessible, as well as improve the gender ratio in the mathematical community.
  * The [team](https://www.sophiefellowship.in/team) consists of many IMO and EGMO medalists, as well as others who have attended the Indian IMO training camp. They have previously participated in Olympiads, we understand the challenges students in the math community face and want to help them.

* The [Online Math Club 2.0](https://sites.google.com/view/online-math-club/home?authuser=0) is a student-run mathematical program that aims to help students from all over India and internationally prepare for mathematical olympiads. The team consists of a group of math enthusiasts who have taken part in these math olympiads in the past, many of whom are also IMO and EGMO medallists and awardees from the Indian National Mathematical Olympiad. The classes run on a Discord server.
  * There are weekly olympiad mathematics sessions on each Saturday and Sunday. Through these classes, a wide range of olympiad mathematical topics are covered that are required for RMO and INMO preparation in each of Combinatorics, Geometry, Number Theory and Algebra, starting from the basics and building up to several advanced topics over the course of the year. [This page](https://sites.google.com/view/online-math-club/overview?authuser=0) contains further details.

## Contests, Programs, Camps

* [International Tournament of Young Mathematicians](https://www.itym.org/)
  > A team competition for high school students from all over the world. 
* [Purple Comet! Math Meet!](https://purplecomet.org/)
  > A team mathematics competition designed for middle and high school students conducted annually since 2003. 

* [Maths Beyond Limits](https://mathsbeyondlimits.eu/mbl/)
* [Maths Beyond Limits Balkans](https://mathsbeyondlimits.eu/balkans/)
* [STEMS](https://tessellate.cmi.ac.in/stems/)
  * Test
  > STEMS (Scholastic Test of Excellence in Mathematical Sciences) is an annual first-of-its-kind open resource examination conducted for students from 8th grade to undergraduates across India. The exam will be held in Mathematics, Physics, and (theoretical) Computer Science in December. The relaxed duration of the exam and original conceptual questions promote academic creativity over rote learning and research interest, increasing the interest and awareness of mathematical sciences amongst the students.
  * Camp
  > About 30 of the best scorers across the three disclipines of STEMS will be selected for a 3-day, fully-funded camp at CMI. Past students selected for this camp include various medalists at the IMO, IOI and few of the brightest school and college students across India.
  * [STEMS 2024 Final Camp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNh_spmAPSMFiwJDjfWZVa_NQX6yohx-C)
* [PROMYS India](https://promys-india.org/)
  > A challenging six-week residential mathematics summer programme, PROMYS India is open to mathematically talented secondary and higher secondary students (Standards IX - XII or equivalent). Meticulously selected students from across India will gather on the campus of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru to immerse themselves in rigorous mathematics.
