## Resources

* Challenge and Thrill of Pre-College Mathematics by V. Krishnamurthy, C.R. Pranesachar, K.N. Ranganathan, B.J. Venkatachala
* Euclidean Geometry in Mathematical Olympiads ([EGMO](https://web.evanchen.cc/geombook.html)) by Evan Chen. The [Automatically Generated EGMO Solutions Treasury](https://web.evanchen.cc/upload/AGEST.pdf) contains updated solutions to a significant number of the sourced problems.
* [OTIS Excerpts](https://web.evanchen.cc/excerpts.html) by Evan Chen for non-geometry.
* Olympiad Combinatorics, by Pranav A. Sriram, is an intermediate-advanced textbook. Its chapters are available in posts \#1, \#11, \#49 of [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h601134). There is a [forum](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c575226_olympiad_combinatorics_pranav_sriram) for solutions of the problems which are not in contest collection but from this book. 
* [Olympiad NT through Challenging Problems](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aops-cdn.artofproblemsolving.com/resources/articles/olympiad-number-theory.pdf), by Justin Stevens, is an introductory olympiad text on number theory. 
* [Modern Olympiad Number Theory](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h2344755), by Aditya Khurmi, is olympiad-oriented. 
* Problems from the Book by Titu Andreescu and Gabriel Dospinescu. Intermediate-advanced textbook covering topics in inequalities, algebra, analysis, combinatorics, and number theory.
* [Recommendations](https://web.evanchen.cc/recommend.html) from [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/) for [handouts](https://web.evanchen.cc/recommend.html#handouts), [books](https://web.evanchen.cc/recommend.html#books) and [contests](https://web.evanchen.cc/recommend.html#contests).
* [Handouts](https://yufeizhao.com/olympiad/) and [book recommendations](https://yufeizhao.com/olympiad/#book-recommendations) by [Yufei Zhao](https://yufeizhao.com/).
* Rustam Turdibaev and Olimjon Olimov compiled a [336-problem index](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G9a5f6EW9cIDw5rTMI46iLlc4UMs6KRW/view) of recent problems by subject and [MOHS rating](https://web.evanchen.cc/problems.html#mohs) ([devised](https://web.evanchen.cc/upload/MOHS-hardness.pdf) by Evan Chen).
* [Olympiad Problems and Solutions](https://web.evanchen.cc/problems.html) by [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/).
