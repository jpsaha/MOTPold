Its chapters are available in posts \#1, \#11, \#49 of [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h601134). There is a [forum](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c575226_olympiad_combinatorics_pranav_sriram) for solutions of the problems which are not in contest collection but from this book. 
* [Olympiad NT through Challenging Problems](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aops-cdn.artofproblemsolving.com/resources/articles/olympiad-number-theory.pdf), by Justin Stevens, is an introductory olympiad text on number theory. 
* [Modern Olympiad Number Theory](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h2344755), by Aditya Khurmi, is olympiad-oriented. 
* Problems from the Book by Titu Andreescu and Gabriel Dospinescu. Intermediate-advanced textbook covering topics in inequalities, algebra, analysis, combinatorics, and number theory.
* The [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html) program by Evan Chen and [people](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html#people).
