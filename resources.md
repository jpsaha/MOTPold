## A few training programs

#### The [OTIS program](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html)
* Olympiad Training for Individual Study, run by [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/) and [people](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html#people), is **a proof-based olympiad training program, with over [300 students](https://web.evanchen.cc/upload/public-CV.pdf) per year from across the world**. Some of its [alums](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html#staff) are 
    * [Anant Mudgal](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=25764), participated in IMO in 2015 (HM), 2016 (B), 2017 (B), 2018 (S), and in APMO in [2016](https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/IND/2016) (B), [2017](https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/IND/2017) (S),
    * [Pranjal Srivastava](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=28249), participated in IMO in 2018 (S), 2019 (G), 2021 (G), 2022 (G), and in APMO in [2018](https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/IND/2018) (HM), [2019](https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/IND/2019) (G), [2022](https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/IND/2022) (G),

* [Sunaina Pati](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/student-profile.php?id=sunaina.ug2023), who [received](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2282/) a Silver medal in [EGMO 2023](https://www.egmo.org/egmos/egmo12/), remarked the following in a post discussing [How to start with Math olympiads](https://www.omath.club/2022/03/how%20to%20start%20with%20math%20olympiads.html).
> Do join OTIS! It is simply so good. Evan is also very kind with financial aid. Moreover, do not be scared of applying! And if there is some financial burden, do tell to Evan.

#### [The Sophie Fellowship](https://www.sophiefellowship.in/home)
  * It is a training program and fellowship for students preparing for IMO, EGMO, INMO and other national and international mathematical competitions.
  * It is run by a bunch of students who really like math and want to spread it further in the country.
  * The [team](https://www.sophiefellowship.in/team) consists of many IMO and EGMO medalists, as well as others who have attended the Indian IMO training camp. They have previously participated in Olympiads, we understand the challenges students in the math community face and want to help them. 
  * [Sunaina Pati](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/student-profile.php?id=sunaina.ug2023), who [received](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2282/) a Silver medal in [EGMO 2023](https://www.egmo.org/egmos/egmo12/), remarked the following in a post discussing [How to start with Math olympiads](https://www.omath.club/2022/03/how%20to%20start%20with%20math%20olympiads.html).
> Sophie Fellowship is the gem! It provides such a nice community and so many resources!
