<h2 align="center">👋 Hello! I'm Jyoti Prakash Saha. </h2>

- 🔭 I’m currently working at the [Department of Mathematics](https://maths.iiserb.ac.in/), [IISER Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/) as an Assistant Professor.
- I am the **Regional Coordinator of the Mathematics Olympiad program for the Madhya Pradesh region**.
- 📫 For any **queries related to the Mathematics Olympiad** program, please feel free to **reach me at** <a href="mailto:jpsaha@iiserb.ac.in?subject=[MOPSS]"> 
      <i class="fas fa-envelope" style="color:gray"></i> jpsaha@iiserb.ac.in
    </a> 

-------

<h2 align="center">👋 Goal of <a href="https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/">this website</a> (aka Why another website? What is its use?!) </h2>

- To provide a brief introduction to Mathematical Olympiad.
- To serve as a website for the [MOPSS](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/MOPSS/) program at IISER Bhopal, to be held in person, from August 2024 to November 2024.
  - We have plans to post notes containing the details of those sessions. 
- To provide handouts on the topics of [Algebra](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/algebra/), [Combinatorics](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/combinatorics/), [Geometry](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/geometry/), and [Number Theory](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/numbertheory/), and to keep it posted in an organized manner across different sub-topics.
  - These notes may be useful to the students who would like to have a look at some of the past RMO problem before getting started, or just curious about it.
  - These notes may also serve as a reference to anyone who would like to provide guidance to students, and but may not have enough time to organize the relevant questions across the topics and sub-topics. 
- To provide assistance to anyone on Mathematics Olympiad.

-------
<h2 align="center">👋 I am enthusiastic about math/math olympiads and/or teaching math to high schoolers. How may I contribute? </h2>

- One may reach to schools, to high schoolers. 
- One may explain about Olympiads, and spread awareness about it.
- One may encourage people (for instance, students, teachers or anyone enthusiastic/curious about math olympiad) to go through this website (and suggest a careful reading of the homepage!).
- Next, a student interested in math olympiad, may browse through the handouts posted here (this will grow with time).
- A person with passion in teaching high school students could use the handouts as a problem bag, or in other way.
- What else? For instance, if one has interest in a science subject(s) other than (or parallel to) mathematics, then one may refer to the webpage of HBCSE, which has information about olympiads ([past papers](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/how-to-prepare/past-papers/)) on the above subjects, and may repeat the same process as above adapted to those subjects!
  - Astronomy
  - Biology
  - Chemistry
  - Junior Science
  - Physics

-------
<h2 align="center">👋 I do not have much time for the above, but I find it interesting. Is there something that I can do? </h2>
- Yes! You could spread the message by 
  - sharing the link [https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/)
  - and suggeting to go through this page, that is the homepage [https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/), to find what all this is about!

## <span style="color: royalblue"> Why math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers </span>
* The post by Evan Chen on [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/) is worth reading.
* In a previous post, titled [Against the “Research vs. Olympiads” Mantra](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2016/08/13/against-the-research-vs-olympiads-mantra/), Evan Chen discussed why math olympiads should not be judged by their relevance to research mathematics. He mentions that in that post, he failed to actually explain why he thinks math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers. In the post [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/), he puts the amends. 


## Participation of India in <span style="color: green"> **International Mathematical Olympiads**</span>
* [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/) (IMO) since [1989](https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=IND).
* [Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad](https://www.apmo-official.org/) (APMO) since [2015](https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/IND/all). 
* [European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.egmo.org/) (EGMO) since [2015](https://www.egmo.org/countries/country35/).

If you (the reader!) are aware of these Olympiads, and would like to prepare for them, then you may wish to know about a few training programs.
