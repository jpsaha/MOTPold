## [Problem Solving Sessions at IISER Bhopal](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/pssb/)

* A series of Problem Solving Sessions will be organized at IISER Bhopal in person.
  * The aim is to develop an interest in mathematics among the students by encouraging them to work on problems falling broadly within the scope of the Mathematical Olympiad.
  * The schedule of the forthcoming sessions are as follows.
    * 3rd, 17th, 31st August, 2024.
    * 14th, 28th September, 2024.

  * The meetings will be held during 9:00am to 12:00pm.
  * Applications to be accepted during June, 2024 through a Google form.
  * A problem set will be available through the form. While filling in the form, the solutions to these problems (or the details of the progress made) are to be submitted.
  * The students, selected for participation in the session, will be informed in July 15, 2024.

[Geoff Smith](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgcs/advice.html) remarked the following in the foreword to the text [Infinity](http://prac.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~kwasnicki/pl/o/infinity.pdf) by Hojoo Lee, Tom Lovering, and Cosmin Pohoata.

>The nations which do consistently well at this competition (IMO) must have at least one (and probably at least two) of the following attributes:
> * A large population.
> * A significant proportion of its population in receipt of a good education.
> * A well-organized training infrastructure to support mathematics competitions.
> * A culture which values intellectual achievement.
>
> Alternatively, you need a cloning facility and a relaxed regulatory framework.

## [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)
* The International Mathematical Olympiad ([IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)) is the World Championship Mathematics Competition for High School students. It is held annually in a different country.
* The [IMO Foundation](https://imof.co/) is a charity which supports the IMO.

> It is the aim of the IMO to bring young people together from all over the world to enjoy the challenges of mathematics in a spirit of friendly competition. This provides a stimulus for Mathematics in each of the participating countries as young people strive for selection. Whist clearly it is a competitive event, for most participants, it is the people that they meet and the shared joy of discovery that is what they regard as most worthwhile. It is common that lifelong friendships are forged at IMO events.

* The [first IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/year_country_r.aspx?year=1959) was held in Romania in 1959, with seven countries participating.
* It has since been held annually, except in 1980.
* Currently, it has expanded to over 100 countries across the globe.
* Each country sends a team of up to six students. 
* In the recent past,
  * Japan was the host for [IMO2023](https://imo2023.jp/en/),
  * Norway was the host for [IMO2022](https://www.imo2022.org/),
  * Russian Federation was the host for [IMO2020](https://imo2020.ru/), IMO2021. 
* The forthcoming IMOs have been scheduled.
  * [IMO2024](https://www.imo2024.uk/) will take place in UK during July, 2024.
  * IMO2025 will be [held](https://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx) in Australia.
  * IMO2026 will be [held](https://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx) in People's Republic of China.
  * IMO2027 will be [held](https://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx) in Hungary. 
* IMO is held over two consecutive days with 3 problems each. Each day, the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. Each problem is worth 7 points for a maximum total score of 42 points.
* The problems are arranged so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6, where the Day 1 problems Q1, Q2, and Q3 are in increasing difficulty, and the Day 2 problems Q4, Q5, and Q6 are in increasing difficulty.

## Preparation 
Here are some of the [suggestions](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-contest.html#C-0) from [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/).

> * Pick up any standard textbook to work through, so you learn some of the standard theory that is tested in math contests. 
> * Go through some past problems from previous contests. 
> * Rope some friends into learning with you. It’s more fun that way, and you can learn from each other. 
> * You should repeat these steps until you have some comfort with the kinds of problems that appear.
> * As you get experience, you will automatically start to know what deep understanding feels like. 
> * Be aware that you will see many, many problems which you can’t solve, where you read the solution and ask, “how was I supposed to think of that?”. This is okay and expected: it’s not because you’re dumb, it’s because you are learning.
