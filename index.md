## Problem Solving Sessions at IISER Bhopal

* A series of Problem Solving Sessions will be organized at IISER Bhopal.
  * The aim is to develop an interest for mathematics among the students, through encouraging them to work on problems, falling broadly within the scope of Mathematical Olympiad.
  * The first session will tentatively take place in August, 2024.
  * Please feel free to get in touch!
 

## Mathematical Olympiad
* The International Mathematical Olympiad ([IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)) is the World Championship Mathematics Competition for High School students. It is held annually in a different country. 
* The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959, with seven countries participating.
* It has since been held annually, except in 1980 and 2020. 
* Currently, it has expanded to over 100 contries accross the globe.
* Each country sends a team of up to six students. 
* [IMO2024](https://www.imo2024.uk/), the 65th IMO, will take place in UK during July, 2024.
* In the recent past,
  * Japan was the host for IMO2023,
  * Norway was the host for IMO2022,
  * Russian Federation was the host for IMO2020, IMO2021. 
* IMO is held over two consecutive days with 3 problems each. Each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. Each problem is worth 7 points for a maximum total score of 42 points.
* The problems are arranged so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6, where the Day 1 problems Q1, Q2, and Q3 are in increasing difficulty, and the Day 2 problems Q4, Q5, and Q6 are in increasing difficulty. 

## Participation of India in IMO
* [India](https://www.imo-official.org/country_info.aspx?code=IND) has been participating in IMO since 1989, and has been a host in 1996.
* India has received 16 Gold medals, 73 Silver medals, 79 Bronze medals, and there were 28 Honourable mentions.
* India ranked 
  * 7th in 1998 (G, G, G, S, S, S),
  * 7th in 2001 (G, G, S, S, B, B),
  * 9th in 2002 (G, S, S, S, B, B),
  * 11th in 2012 (G, G, S, S, S, HM),
  * 9th in 2023 (G, G, S, S, B, B).
<!-- ~~In 1991 - 1995, 1999 - 2000, 2003 - 2010, 2013 - 2018, there were no Gold medalists.~~ -->
* In each IMO held during 2019 - 2023, at least one participant from India obtained a Gold medal. 
* Some of the past contestants are
  * Riddhipratim Basu
  * Chetan Balwe
  * Ashay Burungale
  * Subhash Ajit Khot
  * Abhinav Kumar
  * Kartik Prasanna
  * Sucharit Sarkar
  * K Soundararajan
* Pranjal Srivastava is the first participant from India who received three Gold medals in IMO (2019, 2021, 2022). He also received a Silver medal in 2018.

## Participation of India in Mathematical Olympiads
* [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/) since [1989](https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=IND).
* [APMO](https://www.apmo-official.org/) since [2015](https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/IND/all). 
* [EGMO](https://www.egmo.org/) since [2015](https://www.egmo.org/countries/country35/).

## Mathematical Olympiad program in India

The Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education ([HBCSE](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/)) organizes the Mathematical Olympiad program in India. 

### Eligibility and its stages
* Indian Olympiad Qualifier in Mathematics (IOQM) is a three hour examination with 30 questions.
* The students enrolled in the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th standard may participate. `[^1]`{=markdown}
 `[^1]:`{=markdown} provided certain additional conditions are met. The precise details are available at the [webpage](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/) of the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE). 
* Regional Mathematical Olympiad (RMO) is a three-hour examination with six problems.
* Indian National Mathematical Olympiad (INMO), held on the third Sunday of January.
* International Mathematical Olympiad Training Camp (IMOTC), held from April to May, leading to the selection of six students to represent India at IMO.
* Pre-Departure Camp (PDC) held before leaving for IMO.


### From Madhya Pradesh
* 144 students qualified in IOQM 2023
* 39 students qualified in RMO 2023

### Syllabus
* Algebra
* Combinatorics
* Geometry
* Number Theory

## Let's go through a few problems

## Preparation 
* Pick up any standard textbook to work through, so you learn some of the standard theory that is tested in math contests. 
* Go through some past problems from previous contests. 
* Rope some friends into learning with you. It’s more fun that way, and you can learn from each other. 
* You should repeat these steps until you have some comfort with the kinds of problems that appear.
* As you get experience, you will automatically start to know what deep understanding feels like. 
* Be aware that you will see many, many problems which you can’t solve, where you read the solution and ask, “how was I supposed to think of that?”. This is okay and expected: it’s not because you’re dumb, it’s because you are learning.
