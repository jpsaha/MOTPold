## [Mathematics Olympiad Problem Solving Sessions](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/MOPSS/) (MOPSS)

  * The Department of Mathematics, IISER Bhopal, would be organizing a series of Mathematics Olympiad Problem Solving Sessions (MOPSS). 
  * The aim is to develop an interest in mathematics among the students by encouraging them to work on problems falling broadly within the scope of the Mathematical Olympiad.
  * The forthcoming sessions will be held on the following dates, during 9:00am to 12:00pm.
    * 3rd, 17th, 31st August, 2024.
    * 14th, 28th September, 2024.
    * 19th October, 2024.
    * 2nd, 16th, 30th November, 2024.
  * Applications are to be accepted <span style="color: royalblue"> **until 07th July, 2024** </span> through the <span style="color: royalblue"> Google form</span> posted at [**this link**](https://forms.gle/B9wQteEtGXvCj3AH9). 
  * In the Google form, the link to [**this problem set**](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/MOPSS/PS0B24Aug) has been provided. While filling in the form, the solutions to these problems (or the details of the progress made) are to be submitted.
  * The students, selected for participation in the session, will be informed by <span style="color: royalblue"> **25th July, 2024** </span>.
  * Please refer to the [flyer](static_files/MOPSS/flyer.pdf) for further information.
  * For more information, you may write to
    * Jyoti Prakash Saha (jpsaha@iiserb.ac.in),
    * Kartick Adhikari (kartick@iiserb.ac.in),
    * Manas Kar (manas@iiserb.ac.in). 


## <span style="color: royalblue"> Why math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers </span>
* The post by Evan Chen on [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/) is worth reading.
* In a previous post, titled [Against the “Research vs. Olympiads” Mantra](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2016/08/13/against-the-research-vs-olympiads-mantra/), Evan Chen discussed why math olympiads should not be judged by their relevance to research mathematics. He mentions that in that post, he failed to actually explain why he thinks math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers. In the post [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/), he puts the amends. 


## Participation of India in <span style="color: green"> **International Mathematical Olympiads**</span>
* [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/) (IMO) since [1989](https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=IND).
* [Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad](https://www.apmo-official.org/) (APMO) since [2015](https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/IND/all). 
* [European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.egmo.org/) (EGMO) since [2015](https://www.egmo.org/countries/country35/).

If you (the reader!) are aware of these Olympiads, and would like to prepare for them, then you may wish to know about a few training programs.

## Mathematical Olympiad program in India

The [Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/) (HBCSE) organizes the Mathematical Olympiad program in India. 

### [Eligibility](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/how-to-participate/eligibility/mathematical-olympiad/) and its [stages](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/about-olympiads/stages/mathematical-olympiad/)
* The students enrolled in the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th standard may participate. [^1]
  [^1]: provided certain additional conditions are met. The precise details are available at the [webpage](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/) of the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE).
* Indian Olympiad Qualifier in Mathematics (IOQM) is a three hour examination with 30 questions. 
* Regional Mathematical Olympiad (RMO) is a three-hour examination with six problems.
* Indian National Mathematical Olympiad (INMO), held on the third Sunday of January.
* International Mathematical Olympiad Training Camp (IMOTC), held from April to May. Through the TSTs (Team Selection Tests), it leads to the selection of six students to represent India at IMO.
* Pre-Departure Camp (PDC) held before leaving for [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/).
* These also apply to participation in the [EGMO](https://www.egmo.org/) and [APMO](https://www.apmo-official.org/).
* [INMOTC](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/faq/) is organized before INMO. 

## The [Math Olympiad program organized by HBCSE](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brochure-maths-Olympiad-2023-24.pdf), is the <span style="color: red"> only one </span> leading to participation in the <span style="color: green"> International </span> Mathematical Olympiads. <span style="color: red"> No other contests are recognized. </span>
