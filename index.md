## Programs, Camps, and Contests

* [STEMS](https://tessellate.cmi.ac.in/stems/)
  * Test
  > STEMS (Scholastic Test of Excellence in Mathematical Sciences) is an annual first-of-its-kind open resource examination conducted for students from 8th grade to undergraduates across India. The exam will be held in Mathematics, Physics, and (theoretical) Computer Science in December. The relaxed duration of the exam and original conceptual questions promote academic creativity over rote learning and research interest, increasing the interest and awareness of mathematical sciences amongst the students.
  * Camp
  > About 30 of the best scorers across the three disclipines of STEMS will be selected for a 3-day, fully-funded camp at CMI. Past students selected for this camp include various medalists at the IMO, IOI and few of the brightest school and college students across India.

[Geoff Smith](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgcs/advice.html) remarked the following in the foreword to the text [Infinity](http://prac.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~kwasnicki/pl/o/infinity.pdf) by Hojoo Lee, Tom Lovering, and Cosmin Pohoata.

>The nations which do consistently well at this competition (IMO) must have at least one (and probably at least two) of the following attributes:
> * A large population.
> * A significant proportion of its population in receipt of a good education.
> * A well-organized training infrastructure to support mathematics competitions.
> * A culture which values intellectual achievement.
>
> Alternatively, you need a cloning facility and a relaxed regulatory framework.

## [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/) (IMO)
* The International Mathematical Olympiad ([IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)) is the World Championship Mathematics Competition for High School students. It is held annually in a different country.
* The [IMO Foundation](https://imof.co/) is a charity which supports the IMO.

> It is the aim of the IMO to bring young people together from all over the world to enjoy the challenges of mathematics in a spirit of friendly competition. This provides a stimulus for Mathematics in each of the participating countries as young people strive for selection. Whist clearly it is a competitive event, for most participants, it is the people that they meet and the shared joy of discovery that is what they regard as most worthwhile. It is common that lifelong friendships are forged at IMO events.

* The [first IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/year_country_r.aspx?year=1959) was held in Romania in 1959, with seven countries participating.
* It has since been held annually, except in 1980.
* Currently, it has expanded to over [100 countries](https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=2023) across the globe.

* Pre-Departure Camp (PDC) held before leaving for [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/).
* These also apply to participation in the [EGMO](https://www.egmo.org/) and [APMO](https://www.apmo-official.org/).
* [INMOTC](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/faq/) is organized before INMO. 

## The [Math Olympiad program organized by HBCSE](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brochure-maths-Olympiad-2023-24.pdf), is the <span style="color: red"> only one </span> leading to participation in the <span style="color: green"> International </span> Mathematical Olympiads. <span style="color: red"> No other contests are recognized. </span>

## Preparation 
Here are some of the [suggestions](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-contest.html#C-0) from [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/).

> * Pick up any standard textbook to work through, so you learn some of the standard theory that is tested in math contests. 
> * Go through some past problems from previous contests. 
> * Rope some friends into learning with you. It’s more fun that way, and you can learn from each other. 
> * You should repeat these steps until you have some comfort with the kinds of problems that appear.
> * As you get experience, you will automatically start to know what deep understanding feels like. 
> * Be aware that you will see many, many problems which you can’t solve, where you read the solution and ask, “how was I supposed to think of that?”. This is okay and expected: it’s not because you’re dumb, it’s because you are learning.
