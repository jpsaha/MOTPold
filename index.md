## Problem Solving Sessions at IISER Bhopal

* A series of Problem Solving Sessions will be organized at IISER Bhopal.
  * The aim is to develop an interest in mathematics among the students by encouraging them to work on problems falling broadly within the scope of the Mathematical Olympiad.
  * The first session will tentatively take place in August 2024.
  * For more information, you may write to
    * Kartick Adhikari (kartick@iiserb.ac.in),
    * Jyoti Prakash Saha (jpsaha@iiserb.ac.in). 
 
## IMO
* The International Mathematical Olympiad ([IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)) is the World Championship Mathematics Competition for High School students. It is held annually in a different country.
* The [IMO Foundation](https://imof.co/) is a charity which supports the IMO.

> It is the aim of the IMO to bring young people together from all over the world to enjoy the challenges of mathematics in a spirit of friendly competition. This provides a stimulus for Mathematics in each of the participating countries as young people strive for selection. Whist clearly it is a competitive event, for most participants, it is the people that they meet and the shared joy of discovery that is what they regard as most worthwhile. It is common that lifelong friendships are forged at IMO events.

* The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959, with seven countries participating.
* It has since been held annually, except in 1980.
* Currently, it has expanded to over 100 countries across the globe.
* Each country sends a team of up to six students. 
* In the recent past,
  * Japan was the host for [IMO2023](https://imo2023.jp/en/),
  * Norway was the host for [IMO2022](https://www.imo2022.org/),
  * Russian Federation was the host for [IMO2020](https://imo2020.ru/), IMO2021. 
* The upcoming IMOs have been scheduled.
  * [IMO2024](https://www.imo2024.uk/) will take place in UK during July, 2024.
  * IMO2025 will be [held](https://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx) in Australia.
  * IMO2026 will be [held](https://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx) in People's Republic of China.
  * IMO2027 will be [held](https://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx) in Hungary. 
* IMO is held over two consecutive days with 3 problems each. Each day, the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. Each problem is worth 7 points for a maximum total score of 42 points.
* The problems are arranged so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6, where the Day 1 problems Q1, Q2, and Q3 are in increasing difficulty, and the Day 2 problems Q4, Q5, and Q6 are in increasing difficulty. 

## Participation of India in IMO
* [India](https://www.imo-official.org/country_info.aspx?code=IND) has been participating in IMO since 1989, and has been a host in the year 1996.
* [India](https://www.imo-official.org/country_info.aspx?code=IND) has received 16 Gold medals, 73 Silver medals, 79 Bronze medals, and 28 Honourable mentions.
* India [ranked](https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=IND)
  * 7th in 1998 (G, G, G, S, S, S),
  * 7th in 2001 (G, G, S, S, B, B),

<!-- ~~In 1991 - 1995, 1999 - 2000, 2003 - 2010, 2013 - 2018, there were no Gold medalists.~~ -->
* In each IMO held during 2019 - 2023, at least one participant from India [obtained](https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=IND) a Gold medal. 
* Some of the past [contestants](https://www.imo-official.org/country_individual_r.aspx?code=IND) are
  * Riddhipratim Basu
  * Chetan Balwe
  * Ashay Burungale
  * Subhash Ajit Khot
  * Abhinav Kumar
  * Kartik Prasanna
  * Sucharit Sarkar
  * K Soundararajan
* [Pranjal Srivastava](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=28249) is the first participant from India who received three Gold medals in IMO (2019, 2021, 2022). He also received a Silver medal in IMO2018, and a bronze medal in [IOI2021](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/7475). 
 He appears in IMO's [Hall of Fame](https://www.imo-official.org/hall.aspx).

## Mathematical Olympiad program in India

The Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education ([HBCSE](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/)) organizes the Mathematical Olympiad program in India. 

### [Eligibility](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/how-to-participate/eligibility/mathematical-olympiad/) and its [stages](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/about-olympiads/stages/mathematical-olympiad/)
* Indian Olympiad Qualifier in Mathematics (IOQM) is a three hour examination with 30 questions.
* The students enrolled in the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th standard may participate. [^1]
  [^1]: provided certain additional conditions are met. The precise details are available at the [webpage](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/) of the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE). 
* Regional Mathematical Olympiad (RMO) is a three-hour examination with six problems.
* Indian National Mathematical Olympiad (INMO), held on the third Sunday of January.
* International Mathematical Olympiad Training Camp (IMOTC), held from April to May, leading to the selection of six students to represent India at IMO.
* Pre-Departure Camp (PDC) held before leaving for IMO.

### From Madhya Pradesh

## Let's go through a few problems

* [A1](slides/3Mod4NotSumOfTwoSq.pdf)
* [C1](slides/putnam.pdf)
* [C2](slides/MMO2015.pdf)

## Preparation 
* Pick up any standard textbook to work through, so you learn some of the standard theory that is tested in math contests. 
* Go through some past problems from previous contests. 
* Rope some friends into learning with you. It’s more fun that way, and you can learn from each other. 
* You should repeat these steps until you have some comfort with the kinds of problems that appear.
* As you get experience, you will automatically start to know what deep understanding feels like. 
* Be aware that you will see many, many problems which you can’t solve, where you read the solution and ask, “how was I supposed to think of that?”. This is okay and expected: it’s not because you’re dumb, it’s because you are learning.
