## [Mathematics Olympiad Problem Solving Sessions](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/MOPSS/) (MOPSS)

  * The Department of Mathematics, IISER Bhopal, would like to organize a series of Mathematics Olympiad Problem Solving Sessions (MOPSS). 
  * The aim is to develop an interest in mathematics among the students by encouraging them to work on problems falling broadly within the scope of the Mathematical Olympiad.
  * The forthcoming sessions will be held on the following dates, during 9:00am to 12:00pm.
    * 3rd, 17th, 31st August, 2024.
    * 14th, 28th September, 2024.
    * 19th October, 2024.
    * 2nd, 16th, 30th November, 2024.
  * Applications to be accepted <span style="color: royalblue"> **until 07th July, 2024** </span> through a <span style="color: royalblue"> **Google form**</span>. (<span style="color: green">**Its link is to be posted before 20th June, 2024**</span>. Once it is posted, it will be announced on the [updates](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/updates/) page.)
  * In the Google form, the link to [**this problem set**](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/MOPSS/PS0B24Aug) has been provided (<span style="color: green">**This link is to be activated before 20th June, 2024**</span>. Once it is posted, it will be announced on the [updates](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/updates/) page.). While filling in the form, the solutions to these problems (or the details of the progress made) are to be submitted.
  * The students, selected for participation in the session, will be informed by <span style="color: royalblue"> **25th July, 2024** </span>.
  * Please refer to the [flyer](static_files/MOPSS/flyer.pdf) for further information.

## <span style="color: royalblue"> Why math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers </span>
* The post by Evan Chen on [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/) is worth reading.
  * In a previous post, titled [Against the “Research vs. Olympiads” Mantra](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2016/08/13/against-the-research-vs-olympiads-mantra/), Evan Chen discussed why math olympiads should not be judged by their relevance to research mathematics. He mentions that in that post, he failed to actually explain why he thinks math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers. In the post [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/), he puts the amends.
