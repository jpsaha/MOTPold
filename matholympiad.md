[Geoff Smith](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgcs/advice.html) remarked the following in the foreword to the text [Infinity](http://prac.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~kwasnicki/pl/o/infinity.pdf) by Hojoo Lee, Tom Lovering, and Cosmin Pohoata.

>The nations which do consistently well at this competition (IMO) must have at least one (and probably at least two) of the following attributes:
> * A large population.
> * A significant proportion of its population in receipt of a good education.
> * A well-organized training infrastructure to support mathematics competitions.
> * A culture which values intellectual achievement.
>
> Alternatively, you need a cloning facility and a relaxed regulatory framework.


## [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/) (IMO)
* The International Mathematical Olympiad ([IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)) is the World Championship Mathematics Competition for High School students. It is held annually in a different country.
* The [IMO Foundation](https://imof.co/) is a charity which supports the IMO.

> It is the aim of the IMO to bring young people together from all over the world to enjoy the challenges of mathematics in a spirit of friendly competition. This provides a stimulus for Mathematics in each of the participating countries as young people strive for selection. Whist clearly it is a competitive event, for most participants, it is the people that they meet and the shared joy of discovery that is what they regard as most worthwhile. It is common that lifelong friendships are forged at IMO events.

* The [first IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/year_country_r.aspx?year=1959) was held in Romania in 1959, with seven countries participating.
* It has since been held annually, except in 1980.
* Currently, it has expanded to over [100 countries](https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=2023) across the globe.
* Each country sends a team of up to six students. 
* In the recent past,
  * Japan was the host for [IMO2023](https://imo2023.jp/en/),
  * Norway was the host for [IMO2022](https://www.imo2022.org/),
  * Russian Federation was the host for [IMO2020](https://imo2020.ru/), IMO2021.
