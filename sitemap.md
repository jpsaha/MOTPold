A brief decription of the layout of [https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/), and its content is provided below. 

## [Mathematics Olympiad Problem Solving Sessions](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/MOPSS/) (MOPSS)
* The Department of Mathematics, IISER Bhopal, would be organizing Mathematics Olympiad Problem Solving Sessions (MOPSS). Its aim is to develop an interest for mathematics among the students, through encouraging them to work on problems falling broadly within the scope of Mathematical Olympiad. Applications are invited from the interested students, enrolled in the 7th, 8th, 9th or 10th standard. The timetable and instructions for the application process may be found at [this page](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/MOPSS/). 

## [Mathematics Olympiad](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/matholympiad/)
* [This page](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/matholympiad/) provides some information about
  * **[International]()** Mathematical Olympiad**[s]()**, 
  * Participation of India in these **[International]()** Mathematical Olympiad**[s]()**.

## [Training Program](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/trainingprogram/)
* A few training programs have been mentioned as [this page](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/trainingprogram/), including
  * [<span style="color: royalblue"> **The OTIS program**</span>](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html)
    * Olympiad Training for Individual Study, run by [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/) and [people](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html#people), is **a proof-based olympiad training program, with over [300 students](https://web.evanchen.cc/upload/public-CV.pdf) per year from across the world**.
  * [<span style="color: royalblue"> **The Sophie Fellowship**</span>](https://www.sophiefellowship.in/home)
    * An initiative run by a bunch of students who really like math and want to spread it further in the country. They aim to improve the quality of math education in India by making Olympiad math more accessible, as well as improve the gender ratio in the mathematical community.
  * [<span style="color: royalblue"> **Online Math Club 2.0**</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/online-math-club)
    * An initiative to reach high school students interested in math and give them a platform to learn more and interact with others. The Club aims to increase exposure to olympiad mathematics and advanced mathematics. And OMC is free and open to all!

## [Mathematical Olympiad program in India](https://jpsaha.github.io/MOTP/eligibility/)
